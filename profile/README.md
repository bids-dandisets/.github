# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to BIDS Dandisets!

The primary difference between this organization and its parent, [github.com/dandisets](https://github.com/dandisets/), lies in the application of the automated BIDS formatting tool [nwb2bids](https://github.com/con/nwb2bids) to each Dandiset.

To see the current status of achieving widespread BIDS compatibility, visit the [dashboard](https://github.com/bids-dandisets/dashboard)!

### BIDS

BIDS neuro, or the Brain Imaging Data Structure, is a community-driven standard for organizing, annotating, and describing neuroimaging and behavioral data.
It defines a consistent folder structure and metadata format (using JSON and TSV files) to make data human- and machine-readable, thereby facilitating data sharing, reproducibility, and use with various software packages in neuroscience research.
BIDS aims to improve data standardization and interoperability across different research groups and laboratories.

### DANDI Archive

Repositories contained in this GitHub organization are individual dandisets providing convenient access to TBs of neural data stored in the BRAIN Initiative [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org).
All individual Dandisets contained in this repository compose [dandi/dandisets](https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/) DataLad superdataset, which also provides code and tools to create and update individual Dandisets.
